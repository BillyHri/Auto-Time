# Auto-Time
A powershell script intended to automatically set the time of your computer to its designated timezone, using your IP address.

Main reason why I made this script, was because my CMOS battery died, and I wasn't really ever bothered to fix it, so I just made this script instead.
If you want to you can run this on boot by moving the script to "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
